/*
working of cpp code while execution :
preprocessors are the programs that provides programme directives 
which will create the expanded sourse from the program code file by preprocessing ,
this expanded file source is pushed to compiler which creates object file .obj from the expanded source code , 
then the linker will link object file to library function and create the the executable file program.exe 

preprocessor directives :#include , #define , #ifndef --all begins with # symbol

# symbol provides a path of the preprocessor program , commands like 'include' provides the extra code in the main program 

types of preprocessors :
1. Macros 
2. File inclusion 
3. conditional compilation 
4. other directives
